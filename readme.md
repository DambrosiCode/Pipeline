# hierarchy.py
Program necessary for generating the transposon hierarchy file as PoPoolationTE2 requires this file format but does not generate it. The process is done in several phases and requires two .csv files generated by the user. First an annotation of transposable elements should be saved in .csv files (annotation.csv). 

A smaller reference file (reference.csv) should be generated by taking the annotation file and trimming it down to unique names for each transposon. Then in a second column the user must manually input the family name for each transposon. Finally the third column must manually be filled in again with the order of the transposon. 
For example an annotation file may look like this

|Annotation|
|------------------------|
|REX1_1_GA::chrI:536673-536882()|
|Helitron_1_GA::chrI:534938-534978()|
|L2_1_GA::chrI:534773-534936()|
|L2_1_GA::chrI:534633-534768()|

Removing extraneous information such as the chromosome, loci, and extra numbers it looks like 

|Annotation|
|------------------------|
|REX1|
|Helitron|
|L2|
|L2|

We can get rid of duplicates and manually add in family and order information through simple literature search

|id|family|order|
|------|----------|--------|
|REX1|REX|LINE|
|Helitron|helitron|DNA|
|L2|L2|LINE|

This then provides a template for the program. It will look for the id in the reference.csv *within* the name of each annotation in annotation.csv. Then, once found, it will add the respective family and order with tab delineation like PoPoolationTE2 requires for its hierarchy file.

Output: hierarchy.txt
